# Frontend Dependency Issue Resolution

This document outlines the steps taken to resolve dependency issues with the frontend application.

## Initial Problem

The user reported an issue with `expo-cli` when trying to start the frontend. The initial attempt to run `npm start` in the `frontend` directory failed with the error: `Cannot find module 'metro/src/lib/TerminalReporter'`.

## Troubleshooting Steps

1.  **Clean Installation:** To resolve the initial error, I first attempted a clean installation of the `node_modules`.
    -   Deleted `frontend/node_modules` and `frontend/package-lock.json`.
    -   Ran `npm install` in the `frontend` directory.

2.  **Dependency Conflict (react vs. react-redux):** The `npm install` command failed with an `ERESOLVE` error. `react-redux@8.1.3` required `react@^16.8 || ^17.0 || ^18.0`, but the project had `react@19.0.0`.

3.  **Attempted Downgrade:** I attempted to downgrade `react` and `react-dom` to version `18.x` in `frontend/package.json`.

4.  **New Dependency Conflict (react vs. react-native):** The downgrade led to a new conflict. `react-native@0.79.6` required `react@^19.0.0`.

5.  **Identifying Compatible Versions:** I used `npm view` to inspect the peer dependencies of `react-redux` and `@reduxjs/toolkit`. I discovered that the latest versions of both packages are compatible with `react@19`.

6.  **Upgrading Packages:** I upgraded `react-redux` and `@reduxjs/toolkit` to their latest versions using the following command:
    ```bash
    npm --prefix ./frontend install @reduxjs/toolkit@latest react-redux@latest
    ```

## Current Status

The dependencies have been successfully installed. The next step is to try starting the frontend application again.
